Let's take a look at what Flipkart has in store for you, shall we?</p>
                <h6 id="footer-notes-h">Buy Electronics Online at Attractive Prices</h6>
                <p id="footer-notes-c">Appliances have become an integral aspect of managing your home. Take a walk through your home and you would know the number of appliances we use to help with our day-to-day activities. Just like how Joey points out in the popular sitcom Friends, all your furniture in your living room would be pointed towards the television. A walk into the kitchen and the work area would give you a glimpse into the importance of having a washing machine, a refrigerator and small appliances, such as a microwave oven, at your disposal. You no longer have to head to a store as you can buy electronics from Flipkart at delightful prices. Choose from an enticing range of products from popular brands such as Sony, Samsung, Philips, Apple and Xiaomi. What's more? You can have these products delivered to your doorstep. Some of the popular appliances that you can buy online include home theaters from Sony, audio players from Samsung, speakers from JBL and video accessories from Philips. That's not all, you also get to buy mobile phones online at great prices. Pick from a wide selection of smartphones which include popular Android phones, such as the Samsung S9 and the Redmi Note 5 and the range of Apple iPhones. All you have to do is open the Flipkart page, type the product of your choice and hit the search button. You'll then be exposed to a wide range of products to choose from.</p>
                <h6 id="footer-notes-h">Buy Clothes and Accessories Online - Variety at Your Fingertips</h6>

You can find a wide collection of apparel for children too.</p>
                <h6 id="footer-notes-h">Buy Home and Furniture Items Online - Everything You Would Need for a Beautiful Pad</h6>

                <p id="footer-notes-c">Reading is a great way to expand your knowledge and enhance your creativity. While the works of RK Narayan or Durjoy Datta would take you through relatable emotions via interesting characters and situations, authors like JK Rowling and Stephen King have successfully given us a glimpse into an entirely different world brimming of magic and surrealism. Head to your favorite online shopping site and get set to be spoilt for choice with the variety of books which are available at your disposal. From a huge collection of bestsellers to hardbound copies of your favorite modern-day classics like Harry Potter, there are a number of stories to be read and explored across various genres. That's not all, you can also shop online for study materials to help you score better in competitive examinations. Whether you need a textbook to help you understand the basic concepts better or a study guide that has a solution to all your queries, you have access to some of the best study materials online. Flipkart has a wide range of books across categories such as children's books, audiobooks, computer books, cookery books, and handy guides. So, go ahead, order copies of your favorite books online and immerse yourself in a world with characters that stay with you, through thick and thin.</p>
                <h6 id="footer-notes-h">Buying Guides - Your Assistants in Helping You Buy the Most Suitable Products</h6>

The guide will take you through the most important points to look for while buying a phone. You can also have a glance at the various reviews of the products posted by previous buyers that may help you make an informed buying decision.
